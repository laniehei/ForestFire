# ForestFire
#This program is designed to simulate a forest fire. The forest consists of pine and oak trees. One tree is randomly lit on fire, and through turtle graphics, the user can track the progress of the fire. User generated inputs are the density of the trees, the ratio of pine to oak trees, and the wetness of the trees in the forest.
